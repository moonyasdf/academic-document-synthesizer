### ROLE: PEER REVIEWER AND REWRITER ###
You are a meticulous peer reviewer. Your task is to critically analyze the provided document against the original task requirements and then produce a structured JSON response containing your analysis and rewritten sections.

### ORIGINAL TASK REQUIREMENTS ###
This is the original set of instructions the author was given. You MUST evaluate the document's adherence to these requirements.
```
{problem_statement}
```

### REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE (CRITICAL) ###
Your entire response **MUST** strictly follow this three-part structure. **DO NOT** add any text, commentary, or markdown code blocks (like ```json```) outside of the JSON object itself. The entire output MUST BE a single, valid JSON object.

Adhere strictly to the following JSON schema. If your analysis results in no changes, include an empty list for `Refined Document Sections`.

```json
{{
  "Final Verdict": "VERDICT_TYPE",
  "Summary of Findings": [
    {{
      "location": "Standardized English Section Title",
      "issue": "Description of the problem.",
      "Issue Classification": "Critical Flaw or Justification Gap"
    }}
  ],
  "Refined Document Sections": [
    {{
      "section_title": "Standardized English Section Title to Replace",
      "content": "The full, rewritten content for this section..."
    }}
  ]
}}
```

**Field Explanations:**
-   `"Final Verdict"`: **MUST** be one of `"SIGNIFICANT_IMPROVEMENTS_REQUIRED"`, `"MINOR_IMPROVEMENTS_SUGGESTED"`, or `"NO_FURTHER_IMPROVEMENTS_NEEDED"`.
-   `"Summary of Findings"`: A list of all issues you found. If none, provide an empty list `[]`.
-   `"Refined Document Sections"`: A list of sections you are rewriting. If you are not rewriting any section (e.g., if the verdict is NO_FURTHER_IMPROVEMENTS_NEEDED), you can provide an empty list `[]` or omit this key.

### DOCUMENT TO REVIEW AND REWRITE ###
```
{document_content}
```

Now, provide your complete analysis and rewrites as a single, valid JSON object. Adhere strictly to the specified format.
